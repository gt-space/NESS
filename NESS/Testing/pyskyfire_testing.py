# This example will guide you through the creation of an engine,

# plotting functionality. 

# The example is meant to showcase the capabilities of the Pyskyfire
# library in the simplest way possible, not being a good engine 
# design. Please follow proper design principles when designing

# theme later in this example. The most interesting thing that can be done with this thrust chamber is to simulate
# the regenerative cooling of this chamber at steady state during a firing.

# At this point we have obtained the regenerative cooling result for the engine we just designed. We have created
# a lot of data. You could of course take this raw data and process it yourself, that's great! But Pyskyfire has a 
# built in plotting library that helps you plot and tabulate the data you are most likely interested in. 
# The built in plotting consists of a number of classes that plot the data with sensible presets. 
# The instances of those classes can then be added to a report, which is an HTML file that is organized
# easily readable, and portable, so can be shared easily.
